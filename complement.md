When building a full-fledged event loop, there are several additional features and considerations that you need to keep in mind. Here are some important ones:

1. Event Prioritization: Allow events to have different priorities so that critical events can be processed before less important ones. This ensures that important tasks are handled promptly.

2. Timers and Timeouts: Implement a mechanism for setting timers and timeouts. This allows you to schedule events to occur after a certain period of time or to handle events that exceed a specified time limit.

3. Asynchronous Operations: Support asynchronous operations, such as making network requests or performing I/O operations. This involves using non-blocking I/O techniques and callbacks or Promises/Futures to handle the completion of these operations.

4. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to catch and handle exceptions or errors that occur during event processing. Proper error handling ensures the stability and reliability of the event loop.

5. Resource Management: Take care of resource management, such as closing file handles or network connections, when events are completed or when they are no longer needed. This prevents resource leaks and improves efficiency.

6. Signal Handling: Handle operating system signals, such as SIGINT for interrupting the event loop gracefully, to allow for clean termination of the application.

7. Interprocess Communication: Provide support for interprocess communication mechanisms, such as pipes or message queues, to enable communication between multiple processes or threads.

8. Concurrency: Consider concurrency and parallelism in your event loop design. Depending on your requirements, you may need to handle multiple events concurrently or distribute the workload across multiple threads or processes.

9. Performance Optimization: Optimize the event loop's performance by minimizing unnecessary operations, reducing memory usage, and optimizing I/O operations. Techniques like event batching, event coalescing, or using an event-driven architecture can improve performance.

10. Cross-platform Compatibility: Ensure that your event loop is compatible with different operating systems and platforms, as event loop behaviors can vary across different environments.

11. Debugging and Profiling: Provide tools or mechanisms for debugging and profiling the event loop. This can help identify performance bottlenecks, detect and fix issues, and optimize the event loop's behavior.

When building a full-fledged event loop, it's often recommended to leverage existing libraries or frameworks like ReactPHP, Amp, or Swoole. These libraries offer extensive features, performance optimizations, and battle-tested implementations of event-driven architectures, allowing you to focus on your application's logic rather than low-level event management.
